## Glad to see you here!


🚀 I am a Data Engineer passionate about building scalable data pipelines and transforming raw data into actionable insights.   
With expertise in data ingestion, processing, and analytics, I focus on technologies like Python, Apache Spark, Kafka, AWS, SQL, and BigQuery. I've worked on real-world projects involving ETL workflows, data warehousing, and machine learning pipelines, drawing from experiences in fintech and delivery platforms like Fawry and Talabat. My mission is to drive data-driven decisions that power innovative solutions.  

🌟 I'm a continuous learner and problem-solver, always exploring new tools in big data and cloud computing. When I'm not engineering data flows, you'll find me diving into tech blogs or experimenting with open-source contributions.  
Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or drop an email at ahmed.s.sarhan02@gmail.com for data engineering discussions or collaborations! Let's build robust data systems together.

### Projects and Dev Stuffs:  
- **Smart Weather Forecasting for Agriculture Optimization by using Multispectral
 Images (Graduation Project)**:
  Developed an API integration with NASA’s Copernicus program to retrieve real-time satellite images across
 various light wavelengths.
  Applied CNN, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn to identify patterns in crop health, soil composition, and
 environmental factors.
   Built a weather forecasting system using satellite data, deep learning models (CNN, RNN), and rule-based
 methods to enhance agricultural predictions.
   Predicted soil functionality and weather conditions by implementing machine learning models based on
 historical and satellite data.
 - **Weather Forecasting Model using Rnn time series**:
   Built and implemented machine learning models to forecast weather conditions using historical data and
 satellite imagery, validating outcomes against established research.
   Developed a prediction system for meteorological variables such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind
 speed, and atmospheric pressure to improve forecast reliability.
   Applied statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and data sources including RNN time series, LSTMs,
 TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, and SVM to enhance accuracy.
   Analyzed 20 years of meteorological data (1999–2019) using deep neural networks to optimize prediction
 precision.
 - **Predicting House Prices**:
   Adataset containing information about home features was used to predict their selling prices.
 - **Classify Iris Flowers**:
   The popular iris dataset was used to build a model that could classify iris flowers based on the dimensions of
 their sepals and petals.
 - **Diabetes Prediction**:
   Adataset containing patient medical data was used to predict whether a person has diabetes or not.
